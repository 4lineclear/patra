      This site doesn't procure it's own data.
      Instead, the user must setup their own mechanism for getting data.
      This is because I'd rather not pay for the API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the ways data can be inputted:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manual Input</li>
      <li>Automated Input</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
